      <p>This is some random blurb about nothing. I am just typing things to take up some space and
      create the illusion of knowing what I am talking about. I guess I don't, not, know what I am talking about
      but there is always more to learn. Like this vim text editor. It's the best and the worst thing I have ever used in my entire life.
